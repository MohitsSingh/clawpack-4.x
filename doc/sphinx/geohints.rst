Cautionary Hints on using GeoClaw
==================================

As with all of Clawpack, the GeoClaw code is provided as a research
and teaching tool with no guarantee of suitability for any particular
purpose, and no liability on the part of the authors.  See the
:ref:`license` for more details.

The authors believe that GeoClaw can be used for some real-world modeling of
geophysical hazards, and it is currently in use for tsunami hazard assessment
by several research groups.  Version 4.6.1 of the code was approved in 2010 
by the US National Tsunami Hazard
Mitigation Program (`NHTMP <http://nthmp.tsunami.gov/>`_) for use in
modeling work supported by the program, after an extensive benchmarking
project, the results of which can be found on the 
`NTHMP benchmarking page
<http://www.clawpack.org/links/nthmp-benchmarks/index.html>`_.

However, users who wish to apply GeoClaw to the real world should be aware
that doing so properly requires a good understanding of the capabilities and
limitations of the code, the equations they model, and the suitability of
using these equations to model any particular real-world scenario.

The authors of this code have invested considerable time in learning about
appropriate aspects of geohazard modeling, through reading the literature
and working directly with geoscientists who are domain experts.  Even so we
are very cautious in using any results from GeoClaw without performing
sensitivity studies, grid refinement studies, etc., and if possible comparing
results with those obtained by other modeling groups and confirming with
experts that the results are reasonable.
It is impossible to encapsulate the knowledge needed to deal with all the
inaccuracies and uncertainties of geohazard modeling in any piece of
software or its documentation, and there is
no replacement for extensively reading the
literature and finding experts to work with.

Here are a few of the things that should be considered in any GeoClaw
simulation:

* The depth-averaged shallow water equations are a fairly good model for the
  fluid dynamics of tsunamis provided the wave length is long relative to
  the depth of the water.  In particular, for large tsunamis generated by
  subduction zone earthquakes propagating over the ocean, these equations
  may be adequate.  However, even then, they are only an approximation.
  More accurate depth-averaged equations such as Boussinesq equations that
  include dispersive terms may be more accurate.  

* For short wavelength tsunamis such as those generated by landslides,
  shallow water equations are less accurate and dispersive terms can be very
  important.  Incorporating dispersive terms in GeoClaw is planned for the
  future but not yet available.  These limitations should be clearly
  understood.

* GeoClaw solves the nonlinear shallow water equations and
